“AutoNOMOS Model” cars are model vehicle (scale 1:10) developed at the Freie Universität Berlin for educational purposes. The car can be controlled using a cellular phone or can be programmed to drive in fully autonomous mode. The main computer is an Odroid board (XU4 64GB) running Ubuntu Linux and the Robotic Operating System (ROS) on top. The chassis of the vehicle comes from the model-car building community. The vehicle has been motorized with a Brushless DC-Servomotor FAULHABER  2232. Steering is done through a servo motor Adafruit 1404 . 

Here you can find the educational programming code written during WS2018/2019 at Freie Universität Berlin as part of Robotic Course. The course is taught by Professor Prof. Dr. Daniel Goehring (https://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/inf/groups/ag-ki/members/Professoren/Daniel_G__hring1.html)
